# What's SQLilly?
Data is everywhere - from the messages you send your friends on Discord to a cute picture of a dog you saw online. It's hard to imagine life without it.

I believe as a Software Developer, it is fundamental to understand how to interact with all this data. One way is to learn SQL.
